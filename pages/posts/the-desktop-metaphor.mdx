Using a computer wasn't an easy task back in the day - maybe not even today.
Computers were black screens with green letters. Machines that performed a
single task at a time from command input in the terminal. Commands that were
difficult to memorize and almost impossible to deduce.

By 1960, computers were beginning to gain some popularity outside of businesses,
especially among hobbyist groups. People who spent a lot of time reading thick
manuals only to be able to interact with a computer. All this complexity scared
most people and was obviously a major impediment to the popularization of these
fantastic machines.

A radical change in the way you interact with a computer was needed. Something
more visual, closer to the reality of a human being and more distant from the
low level reality of a machine. But the technology needed simply did not exist
for such a paradigm break.

## The mother of all demos

In science we are always leaning on the shoulders of giants. With the invention
of the graphical interface it was no different. There was not really an
inventor, but rather a series of improvements that were made over the previous
generation.

One of the first theorists on the subject was Vannevar Bush, chief engineer of
the Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War II who, in
1945, published an article entitled [“As We May Think”](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)
describing his vision of the future of how we would use machines - called by him
**Memex** - to access a vast set of linked data.

This article inspired [Douglas Engelbart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart).
During his stay at Stanford College in Silicon Valley, he formed the
Augmentation Research Center and conceived some of the basic inventions for the <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>
to be what it is today. Among these inventions was the mouse, a device that
allowed moving a pointer across the screen and manipulating information in a
more flexible and natural way.

> The digital revolution is far more significant than the invention of writing or even of printing.
>
> — Douglas Engelbart

In December 1968 in San Francisco, Douglas Engelbart had demonstrated all the
new inventions made by his team. Among these inventions was the aforementioned
mouse as well as the concept of windows, hypertext, graphics, video
conferencing, word processing, version control and a collaborative text editor.
This presentation was - and is - a milestone in the history of computing, and
became known as **The Mother of All Demos**, the most fantastic and ahead of its
time technical demonstration. It can be - and should be - viewed below.

## PARC

The next wave of innovation in the field of Graphical User Interfaces would take
place in Palo Alto, at Xerox's legendary Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) lab,
where in 1970 much of Engelbart's team went to work. There they refined their
ideas and even managed to implement and market these new ideas in 1981 with the
[Xerox Star computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Star).

Xerox High The Xerox Star was the first commercial computer to come with a
window-based graphical user interface (windows), icons, folders, a mouse,
ethernet network, file server, print server, and email.

It was also the first computer to employ the bit mapping technique. In essence,
everything on the screen of the Xerox Star was an image. The bit mapping
technique simplified the work of graphics and also allowed the computer to
display an exact representation of what would be printed on the screen. What
became known as WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get).

Many credit the invention of graphical interfaces as we know today from PARC.
There, they not only created (refined) the GUI, they also invented
object-oriented programming - with the Smalltalk language - the MVC design
pattern, laser printer, ethernet, WYSIWYG text editors, and so on.

PARC scientists have defined the basis of the Graphical User Interface as WIMP,
for Windows, Icons, Menu and Pointer Device. To date, most desktop systems,
including Windows, OS X, Gnome, KDE, use this base.

On top of these basic elements, the Office Metaphor was created. PARC
scientists, especially Alan Kay, decided to use metaphors for common office
tasks to narrow the learning curve of using a computer.

## The metaphor

The first Graphical User Interface, or GUI, was a metaphor for an
office environment. The desktop represented an office desk. On top
of it were papers, which were computer files.

These same files could be grouped in folders, just as papers are organized in
folders in offices. The files could be thrown in a trash just as it is done in
an office. These files could even be rescued from the bin, just as we can do
with crumpled paper thrown in the trash.

In addition to the office metaphor, the concept of windows was developed. Each
window would represent an open application. Each open application would be the
equivalent of a paper on a table. In it the work would happen.

Apple was largely responsible for the popularization of the GUI. Steve Jobs on a
visit to the Xerox PARC got to know the GUI, and soon realized that this was the
future. Xerox was having trouble selling the Xerox Alto, the only computer that
had ever run a GUI. Jobs then made a proposal to Xerox to buy the GUI, and
implement in what would become the [Apple Lisa](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa).

In the video below we have an Apple television advertisement announcing its new
computer and its GUI with the office metaphor as a differentiator among other
products of the time due to its ease of use. Notice how the actor uses his
finger as a pointer, simulating a mouse, pointing to objects that the Mac
simulates in its interface, such as papers, folders, and a calculator.

</p>

Virtually all operating systems that have adopted a graphical interface have
used or use the office metaphor. Some more purist about their own metaphor,
others more practical.

BeOS, for example, showed an icon of external devices connected to the desktop,
while internal devices were accessed through the computer icon, to be more
faithful to metaphor.

One of the most true implementations of metaphor itself came in 2010 with
BumpTop. The idea of ​​the BumpTop interface was to more effectively simulate an
office desk. In it, documents are small 3D objects that can be stacked,
manipulated using gestures and even tossed around using physical laws for a more
realistic experience.

Unfortunately, the BumpTop product was discontinued shortly after the company
was bought by Google.

## Impacts

The Desktop Metaphor developed by Alan Kay's team is still used today in
all major desktop operating systems. It was an important step for computers to
gain their popularity today. It made possible the use of computers by
non-technical people and opened up different possibilities in the creation of
computer programs, since we were no longer limited to a command line interface.

It is so popular today that, for many, it has outgrown it's "inspiration." When
we talk about folders or files, it comes to mind no longer folders and various
papers, but files and folders on a computer. The desktop name itself is more
closely related to your computer than it is to the top of your desk.
