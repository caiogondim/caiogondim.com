Since I joined The New York Times I have been working on modernizing our
multimedia player. Changing Grunt to npm scripts, from imperative templates to
Preact, using Babel for new JS lang features, simplifying the architecture,
making it harder, faster, better, stronger, ...

I was proud of almost all the decisions I took during those almost 2
years. But one never felt right: **using Redux for state management**.

Using Redux was better than using no state management solution, but I always had
this feeling deep inside that it was the wrong approach. Too verbose and with
its own idioms that didn't play well with native syntax as async/await and
error handling. But I drank the Kool-Aid.

After 1.5 years after first implementing it on the multimedia player, I can
better look in retrospect and see what went well, what didn't, and why I ended
up creating my own state management library.

## Better with than without

Using Redux for our use case was indeed better than not using a state management
library or pattern. It was clear on where to look for state mutators and all
possible state transitions.

## Tooling is amazing

That was probably what got my attention at first with Redux. The
[redux-devtool](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) extension
was a real game changer for our team since the player is a super stateful
application.

## Verbosity

Yeah, everybody complains and knows about that. But I have to say it one more
time. Redux is verbose and full of ceremony. Doing the simplest of the things
(sync state change) is done in 3 steps:

- Defining an action
- Defining a reducer to handle that action
- Dispatching an action

I know there are tons of libraries to remove friction from the above problem,
but that actually created a new one.

## Fragmentation

There is no right way of doing anything on Redux. Need to do an async state
change? Maybe you should use `redux-saga`...or maybe `redux-thunk`. How to
organize code? Redux docs say you should do X, but `re-ducks`
is super popular and says otherwise.

Redux provides you with the basic. But for any production-ready app, you will
need more libraries to fill the holes Redux left and it slowly becomes into a
choose your own adventure kind of game.

## Killing the vibe

Using Redux was just a pain. Having to create a reducer, action, action type
dict, action dispatcher, ..., for trivial things was preventing me from getting
things done and it was ... boring.

## [city-state](https://github.com/caiogondim/city-state.js): my take on state management

Necessity being the mother of invention and me being the great wheel reinventer
both made me decide to take a shot on that state management thing. My
constraints were:

- Has to be backwards compatible with Redux (I can't afford to rewrite the whole source code in one go)
- Compatible with [redux-devtool](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) (too good to give up)
- Encapsulated state (OOP is fine)
- State is changed by message passing (also know as calling methods on instances)
- Leverage new JS lang features

For that I ended up breaking the problem into 3 pieces:

- `subscribable`
- `Subscribe`
- `devtool`

And below I describe how they work together.

## `@subscribable`

Decorator that implements the following interface:

- `this.state`: read-only state cache
- `this._state`: writable state (will be implemented as `this.#state` once [private fields proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields#private-fields) reaches stage 4)
- `this.subscribe`: [Observable](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable) instance subscribe method.
- `this[$$observable]`: [`Symbol.Observable`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable#api) for better Observable compatibility.

Example of a counter class definition:

```js
@subscribable
class Counter {
  constructor() {
    this._state = { count: 0 }
  }

  increment() {
    this._state.count += 1
  }

  decrement() {
    this._state.count -= 1
  }
}

export default Counter
```

Can also be used as a function:

```js
export default subscribable(Counter)
```

For changing the state, just call a method. Whenever `this._state` changes, all
subscribers will run with the new computed state as argument.

```js
const counter = new Counter()
const subscription = counter.subscribe(state => console.log(state)) // => { count: 0 }
counter.increment() // => { count: 1 }

subscription.unsubscribe()
counter.increment() // => Doesn't log anymore
```

It provides a minimal Observable API that can be used for casting to a true
Observable instance:

```js
const counterObservable = rxjs.from(counter)
```

###### `<Subscribe>`

`Subscribe` is a React component that accepts a prop `to` with an array of
Observables and a function as children. Whenever the subscribed observables push
new values, the children function runs with the new values as arguments.

```js
<Subscribe to={[counter]}>
  {(counterState) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <span> Count: {counterState.count} </span>
        <button onClick={() => counter.increment()}>Increment +</button>
        <button onClick={() => counter.decrement()}>Decrement +</button>
      </div>
    )
  }}
</Subscribe>
```

It's compatible with Redux since it also [offers a minimal Observable interface](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/blob/e944bb2a9762c2d423502a838edae48ae86f123d/src/createStore.js#L236).
That enables mixing old and new code, making a step-by-step refactoring possible.

```js
<Subscribe to={[reduxStore]}>
  {currentState => {
    return (
      <div>
        <span> Count: {currentState.count} </span>
        <button onClick={() => reduxStore.dispatch(actions.increment())}>
          Increment +
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => reduxStore.dispatch(actions.decrement())}>
          Decrement +
        </button>
      </div>
    )
  }}
</Subscribe>
```

###### `devtool()`

A function that accepts an observable instance as first argument and an options
object as second. Works with any object that implements the [Observable API](https://observable-api)
(redux store, city-state subscribable, rxjs, ...)

```js
const counter = new Counter()
devtool(counter, { name: 'counter' })
```

###### Conclusion

I'm in no way saying that it's wrong using Redux. It just didn't feel right to
me and my use case. In the end [`city-state`](https://github.com/caiogondim/city-state.js) is a state management library I
created to solve a need I had that was having a tool that better reflects my
programming mental model. And I'm sharing it just in case anyone else feels the
same.
